        <h1>Self-introduction</h1>
        <p>My name is Chen Ding. I'm from China. Now I'm located in London. I studied Journalism 
            and English in undergraduate, but I found out that I'm more into cultural studies. So I chose 
            as many cultural modules as I could, which include many cultural expressions such as 
            literature, art, history, photography, etc.</p>
        <p>I was on an exchange programme at University of Westminster in 2018, and one of the module 
            I had is Modern Art in London. I was able to visit many brilliant museums and galleries 
            because of the module. My favourite exhibition was Knock Knock: Humour in Contemporary Art 
            at South London Gallery. It's a past exhibition but you can still view some pictures on their 
            website, and I also have some picture here. I really like the sense it conveyed, a bit creepy 
            yet humorous right?</p>

        <p>I'm also a big fan of theatre. For those who are also into theatre, you might want to check 
            out the NT Shakespeare app. It's a comprehensive theatre archive developed by National 
            Theatre, including pictures, videos and other documentation of all the Shakespeare productions 
            they've made.</p>
        <p>If anyone is down to explore London and the museums please hit me up. Looking forward to meeting 
            you all!</p>
