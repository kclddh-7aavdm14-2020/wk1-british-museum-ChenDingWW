        <h1>British Museum Expedition</h1>
        <p>The British Museum was established in 1753 mainly based on the collections of the Irish physician and scientist
             Sir Hans Sloane, who bequeathed his collection of 71,000 items to the British nation. It remains a controversial topic that 
            some of British Museum's collections are the result of British colonisation. For example, the famous Elgin Marbles of Greece 
            and the Rosetta Stone of Egypt.</p>
        <p>There are also objects from excavation, purchase, donations and bequests, and commissions from individuals.</p>
        <p>The archive is made for, firstly and obviously, visitors from all over the world and people who don't have access to the real 
            museum. The archive is also made for educational purpose, to be used by schools and communities. Last but not least, it's a 
            platform for sholars and artists to share their knowledge.</p>
        <p>The website is most likely built by a huge team, because of the large number of collections. A lot of work need to be done to 
            put the details of all objects on the website.</p>
        <p>The collections are categorised by themes and the galleries are group by space, i.e. lower/ground/upper fllors and virtual 
            galleries.</p>
        <p>The metadata includes object type, museum number, description of the object, culture/periods, production date, production place,
             findspots, materials, technique, demensions, inscriptions, inscription subject, curator's comments, bibiliographic references, 
            location, exhibition history, condition, subjects, associated names, acquisition name, department, big number, registration number, 
            additional IDs, and conservation.</p>
        <p>The website uses Google street view for virtual tours and Sketchfab for 3D objects.</p>
