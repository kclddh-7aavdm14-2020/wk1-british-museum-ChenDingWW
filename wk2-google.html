        <p>Things from Google Arts & Culture I find special:</p>
                <ul style="color:#44494e">
                <li>It develops a lot of ways to build interaction with visitors, for example, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/camera/selfie">art selfie</a>, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/experiment/what-came-first/ZQGBUPErEE3bVg">game</a>, and <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/camera/art-transfer">artwork transformer</a>, to make visitors get involved. It also provides much fun for the exploration.</li>
                <li>It has a well-built mobile app which visitors can access using their phones anywhere and at anytime.</li>
                <li>It has high-resolution images and videos of artworks for visitors to look into.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>It is very hard to get contents organised and put into categories when there are so many partner institutions thoughout the world. What Google Arts & Culture does is giving visitors different choices to explore the collections in the way they like.
        </p>
        <p>Visitors can go straight into the highlights section if they want to have a quick look at the museums and galleries. They can also go by categories such as <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/category/artist">artists</a>, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/category/medium">mediums</a>, and <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/category/art-movement">art movements</a>, or go by topics such as <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/expressionism/m0pybl?categoryId=art-movement">expressionism, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/watercolor-painting/m018ktp?categoryId=medium">watercolour painting</a>. Collections can also be explored by <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/time?date=2000">time</a> and <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/color?col=GREEN">colour</a>, which I think is a great narrative, especially for online display. Last but not least, there is a <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/partner">list</a> of all the museums and galleries on the bottom so that visitors can go from one to another.

        <p>In a nut shell, what I took from Google Arts & Culture is its various <strong>interactive experience</strong> and its <strong>flexible exploration choices</strong>.</p>
